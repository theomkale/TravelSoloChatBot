Its possible that nltk is not downloaded properly in your sys
Here are some common issues which I faced

if it says some nltk_data package is not found just comment everything and run below code
# Downloaded Nltk_data
# import nltk
# import ssl
#
# try:
#     _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
# except AttributeError:
#     pass
# else:
#     ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context
#
# nltk.download('popular')
# print('done')

licence certificate issue
on mac search for certificates.command and run it

you can train the bot using
# https://towardsdatascience.com/beginners-guide-to-creating-a-powerful-chatbot-48fc6b073e55
i found the above article very usefull


# Training bot on corpus
from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer
# trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(bot)
# trainer.train('chatterbot.corpus.english')
